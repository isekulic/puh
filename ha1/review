Imports: You can import just the functions you need in brackets.
     For example: import Data.Char (ord, chr).
     Thus avoiding the namespace pollution.

Exercises: Here.

Comments: More comments in the future, please.
      See: http://www.haskell.org/haddock/doc/html/markup.html

1.(1/1)
When naming stuff in Haskell, use camel case. Instead of "f_err" "fErr".
Everybody does it :)
Code alignment is terrible.
Align all guards | in the same line.
It could have been done more succintly - see the official solution.
And when programming in any language, it is usually avoided returning 
boolean values explicitely. You return the boolean operation instead.

2.(1/1)
Same as above.

3.(1/1)
Correct, but you are using some redundant brackets.
In the call:
unwords ([.. 
In Haskell you avoid putting funtion arguments in brackets and instead rely
on operator precedence. It takes some time to get used to.

4.(1/1)
It's nice. The assignment it self was the ugly thing.

5.(4/4)
norm: Correct. But see this black magic:
      norm (x, y) = sqrt (x ^2, y ^2)
      You can destructure tuples using pattern matching. Just to wet your
      appetite.
add: Good.
scalarMult: Yep!
dot: Same.

6.(1/1)
Book example.

7.(0.5/1)
Wow, you are overdoing it! All characters should be included, not just letters.
By the way, there is a isAlpha in Data.Char function.
